        "description": "Epoxy resin refers to a type of reactive prepolymer and polymer containing epoxide groups. These resins react either with themselves in the presence of catalysts, or with many co-reactants like amines, phenols, thiols, etc. Epoxy resin has many industrial applications for a variety of purposes.\r\n\r\nThe bonding power and physical strength of epoxy differ widely depending on the resin blend and hardener used, as well as the material to which the epoxy is bonded. In general, the tensile strength of epoxy resins can range from 5,000 to 6,000 psi.\r\n\r\nWhat Is Epoxy Resin Used In?\r\nGeneral-purpose adhesives.\r\nBinder in cement and mortars.\r\nRigid foams.\r\nNon Skid coatings.\r\nSolidifying sandy surfaces in oil drilling.\r\nIndustrial coatings.\r\nPotting and encapsulating media.\r\nFiber-reinforced plastics",
